                <h2>Who was Abu Bakr</h2>
                <p>Abu Bakr or Abdullah Ibn Abi Kuhafa (May Allah be pleased with him) was the best friend and father in law of the Prophet Muhammad (May peace be upon him)
                     and was the first man to accept Islam. He was a rich merchant by trade and 
                     was well respected in the city of Makkah. He was the most knowledgeable of the companions of the Prophet 
                     (May peace be upon him) and the most respected after the Prophet. 
                     He was also the one who accompanied the prophet on the migration to Medina,
                      where they both hid in a cave, due to the Quraish looking to persecute the Prophet.
                     He was given the name '<i>As Siddiq</i>' which means the truthful.</p>
    
    
                <h2>His Appearance</h2>
                <p>Aisha ( May Allah be pleased with her) was asked to describe her father, Abu Bakr, 
                    she said: ‘A fair man, of slender build, thin cheeked and with a stoop;
                     he could not
                    keep his lower garment from slipping over his loins; gaunt-faced, eyes deep-set,
                     with a prominent forehead, and the backs of his hands fleshless. <sup class="footnote" id="1"> <a href="#bottom"> 1 </sup></a></p>

                     <h2>Abu Bakr is appointed as Caliph</h2>
                     <p>Upon the death of the Prophet ( May peace be upon him), 
                        the Companions were left wth a decision on who should be the next leader. It was unanimous that 
                        it should be Abu Bakr since he was the the best friend of the Prophet, the second in the cave, 
                        and most importantly, Abu Bakr was one the prophet chose the lead the prayers when he fell ill.</p>

                        <p>Ali Ibn Abi Talib ( May Allah be pleased with him ) did not oppose this consensus 
                        but it was delayed due Abu Bakr and Fatima Zahra ( May Allah be pleased with her), 
                        Ali’s Wife and the Prophets daughter, not seeing eye to eye in an issue of inheritance.  <sup class="footnote" id="2"> <a href="#bottom">2</a></sup</p>

                        <h2> Abu Bakr's time as Caliph</h2>
                        <p>The first feat of Abu bakr’s caliphate was the conquest of byzantine syria whose leader was Heraclitus at the time.
                            This was a successful expedition led by Usamah bin Zayd.  <sup class="footnote" id="3"> <a href="#bottom">3</a></sup>
                            After the Prophets ( May peace be upon him) death, many hypocrites started to reveal themselves
                             and had apostated from the religion and stopped paying the <i>zakat</i> Tax. To stop this influence from 
                             spreading amongst the Muslims, Abu bakr consulted Usamah Bin Zayd who helped stop this from happening.As a result Islam was further strengthened
                              in reputation across the Arab world.  <sup class="footnote" id="4"> <a href="#bottom">4</a></sup>
                             Another important decision he
                             made was to preserve the Quran in written form. This came after a lot of <i>Huffaz</i> ( people who memorised the quran by heart) were killed in battle, Umar feared
                             that this would result in the Quran being lost so he advised Abu Bakr to compile the Quran in written form  <sup class="footnote" id="5"> <a href="#bottom">5</a></sup></p>

                             <h2>His Illness and death</h2>
                             <p>Abu Bakr ( May Allah be pleased with him ) fell ill with a fever when he was 63 years old, he did not go out to pray this lasted for 15 days until he passed away
                                . Abdullah ibn Umar ( May Allah be pleased with him ) said “The cause of Abu Bakr’s death was the passing away of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. 
                                He was distressed and his body continued to waste away until he died.” <sup class="footnote" id="6"> <a href="#bottom">6</a></sup> He passed in 13AH and his reign lasted little over 2 years.
                                 He was buried in Aisha’s quarters ( May Allah be pleased with her ) next to the Prophet Muhammad ( May peace be upon him ).</p>
